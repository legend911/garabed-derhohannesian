                    Garabed Der Hohannesian is one of the most resourceful and sensitive artists in Boston. 
                    In long, studious researches with color he has learned to use it with meaning and grace. 
                    He works in pure abstraction…through sensitive juxtaposition, he produces sequences, patterns 
                    of movement, modulations of hue, super-positions, augmentations, condensations and rarefactions.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    He fuses light color [and] line. He produces a dynamic on the pictorial surface which parallels 
                    musical composition. Sometimes he sets a line pattern across the figuration of veiled planes, 
                    thus producing the effect of a melodic line against an accompaniment of chords…[he] is resourceful 
                    with various media as well. He works in oil on gesso, gouache, watercolor, mat board, metallic 
                    paper and casein panel on gesso…[he] works with a gentle, modest hand. The non-objective pattern 
                    comes to be a language in itself, beautifully articulate of thought and feeling.

                    As a painter, Garabed Der Hohannesian brings to his own work a superb sense of design, structure 
                    and balance using color, line, light or form. Although he feels a firm connection to and inspiration 
                    from his environment, he expresses this by creatively exploring the design relationships of geometric 
                    shapes, color balance and seemingly meandering line. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    His work ranges from pure abstraction using color 
                    or line in dynamic juxtaposition to suggestions of reality that, with geometric patterns, shaded 
                    tonalities and textures, gave an optical illusion of three-dimensional space. Or, with meticulous pen 
                    and ink drawing and wash, he would invent organic forms or suggest a hidden marsh landscape veiled in 
                    fog. There is a vibrancy and dynamic in his compositions carefully controlled by a formality of design 
                    skill but always a great enjoyment and zest in the complexity of shapes in tilting blocks of color, in 
                    complex line patterns, or webs and vistas of space created by his forms and line.
