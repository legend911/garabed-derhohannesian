                    Garabed DerHohannesian is one of the most resourceful and sensitive artists in Boston. 
                    In long, studious researches with color he has learned to use it with meaning and grace. 
                    He works in pure abstraction…through sensitive juxtaposition, he produces sequences, patterns 
                    of movement, modulations of hue, super-positions, augmentations, condensations and rarefactions.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    He fuses light color [and] line. He produces a dynamic on the pictorial surface which parallels 
                    musical composition. Sometimes he sets a line pattern across the figuration of veiled planes, 
                    thus producing the effect of a melodic line against an accompaniment of chords…[he] is resourceful 
                    with various media as well. He works in oil on gesso, gouache, watercolor, mat board, metallic 
                    paper and casein panel on gesso…[he] works with a gentle, modest hand. The non-objective pattern 
                    comes to be a language in itself, beautifully articulate of thought and feeling.

                    As a painter, Garabed DerHohannesian brings to his own work a superb sense of design, structure 
                    and balance using color, line, light or form. Although he feels a firm connection to and inspiration 
                    from his environment, he expresses this by creatively exploring the design relationships of geometric 
                    shapes, color balance and seemingly meandering line. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    His work ranges from pure abstraction using color 
                    or line in dynamic juxtaposition to suggestions of reality that, with geometric patterns, shaded 
                    tonalities and textures, gave an optical illusion of three-dimensional space. Or, with meticulous pen 
                    and ink drawing and wash, he would invent organic forms or suggest a hidden marsh landscape veiled in 
                    fog. There is a vibrancy and dynamic in his compositions carefully controlled by a formality of design 
                    skill but always a great enjoyment and zest in the complexity of shapes in tilting blocks of color, in 
                    complex line patterns, or webs and vistas of space created by his forms and line.

                <p>
                    Garabed DerHohannesian…has always been a very elegant artist. He works with infinite care and he produces 
                    works which have a real feeling of sensitivity, whether they are drawings of weed-filled pastures or Op-ish 
                    abstractions based on the building blocks of a city.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What impresses me most about his work is that he always seems to be his own man. He never works anyone 
                    else’s side of the street.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    But that, of course, is not enough to account for the very handsome things he turns out…he proves he is 
                    equally at home working in all-white…or in brilliant color. The bravura technique of which he is a master 
                    can be readily seen.

                    The same reverberations distinguish Garabed DerHohannesian’s latest solo of drawings at Carl Siembab’s 
                    [gallery] this month. They range from vibrant and bold abstracts in colored ink to fluent, lyrical landscape, 
                    chiefly marsh grasses drawn with a meticulous and observant draughtmanship.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through diminutive cross-hatchings and swift, controlled strokes, Mr. DerHohannesian introduces engaging 
                    tonalities and textures into his designs. Some of the ink paintings are objects viewed in close-up… these are 
                    effectively patterned, while the color in the abstractions discloses subtlety and brilliance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nonetheless, the most distinguished element comprised the landscapes. The artist captures the rank, swampy 
                    character of the terrain, combined with the structural impact it makes en masse, the isolated wintry splendor 
                    of a dense bare climate. The gentleness with which he treats this attains poetic ease and in the drawing “<i>Thaw</i>” 
                    geometric elements lend a dimension of rare subjectivity as angled slabs recede toward a murky horizon.
